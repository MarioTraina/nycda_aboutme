      Hello my name is Mario Traina as you can tell from the title of this page.
      Sixteen years ago I started out in the working world as and apprentice electrician. After
      having completed a course in sound engineering  with multiple internships and no sign of steady
      or paid work on the horizon, I had to start considering other options. The title electrician
      sounded meaningful and possibly dangerous and that was appealing to me at the time. besides,
      I do come from a family of construction workers and I was already somewhat mechanically inclined
      so it seemed like a good fit. Although I now had a steady job and was learning something new while
       getting paid, which is always nice of course, and I was grateful, it wasn't playing the guitar and
       writing  music and thats where my passion has always been.

       It was the year 2004 that I had finally formed a band with a childhood friend and some other guys
       we found through ads we had posted up in a rehersal studio on the South shore of Staten Island. This
       had marked the end of what seemed to be an eternity of frustrating attempts at failed auditions for other bands, and the beginning of a thirteen
       year long project that had sprouted a brotherhood amomg five strangers. This group of strangers would later become a band known as <a href="https://www.reverbnation.com/woodsofarden">Woods of Arden</a>.
     </p>

        We now had other musically like-minded people to collaborate with and share our unfinished ideas with, so we were
        ready to roll up our sleeves and make a name for ourselves. Like any new relationship, it was smooth sailing
        in the beginning, but that didnt last long. Though we certainly were not short on creativity and ideas, there looming in the
        background were five egos that had to make their place known, each one as stubborn
        as the next. Smooth sailing in calm water would turn out to be a perfect storm for some years to come. We had a lot
        of growing to do; arguments over arrangements of music would escalate into outright bar room brawling in the rehersal
        room. Around the studio we became known as "that troubled family down the block" who in one moment would be as close as
        siblings and in the next arch rivals. However, all of the confused and misdirected risidual adolescent anger would
        prove to be a catalyst that would shape our music and provide lyrical content for songs to come. It took some
        time, patience and commitment as do all friendships that thrive and flourish.

        We went on to write and produce two records that took us around the country, played on mainstream radio stations and countless college and
        internet radio shows. We did live interviews on WPLJ in New York City and WDHA in New Jersey, played in every bar big and small, every rat hole
        and sewer from one end of the city to the other. We even sold out some of the bigger venues, including Webster Hall,
        Grammercy Theatre and Irving Plaza.

        It has been an exciting ride and memorable experience, and I have to say juggling a full-time
        job and doing the music thing was not easy. For the last year and a half we have taken a break from playing live and returned to
        writing new music in the studio. Since then I have gone back to school for math, which I enjoy studying and even more recently turned my
        attention to web development.

        I started out a few months ago on Codecademy fooling around with it and that turned into what seems to be more than
        just an idle interest. I find myself unable to move away from the computer once I get going. I feel like I'm learning a new language and
        at times it gets awfully confusing and frustrating, and when I actually do something purposefully, as trivial as it may be, the reward is compareable
        to a fully expressed piece of original music. My immediate goal now is to learn as much as I can in this field and make a career change from
        electrician to web developer, transitioning from one art form to another.
